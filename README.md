# Customer_Behavior_Analysis
This project analyzes customer data to identify patterns and insights using Python, PostgreSQL, and Power BI. Data is stored in PostgreSQL, processed with Python, and visualized through interactive Power BI dashboards to support data-driven business decisions.

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer shopping behavior to uncover meaningful insights that support data-driven business decisions. The workflow integrates **Python** for data analysis, **PostgreSQL** for structured data storage and querying, and **Power BI** for interactive data visualization. The project demonstrates an end-to-end analytics pipeline from raw data to business insights.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Python** – Data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- **PostgreSQL** – Data storage, SQL querying, aggregation
- **Power BI** – Dashboard creation and insight visualization

## 📂 Project Workflow
1. Raw customer shopping data is loaded and stored in **PostgreSQL**.
2. **SQL queries** are used to extract, filter, and aggregate relevant customer metrics.
3. Data is analyzed in **Python** using pandas and related libraries.
4. Processed data is visualized in **Power BI** using interactive dashboards.

## 📊 Dashboard Results
The Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive view of customer behavior, including:
- Customer distribution across different segments
- Purchase frequency and spending patterns
- Category-wise and trend-based analysis
- Key performance indicators (KPIs) for business evaluation

These visualizations make it easier to identify trends, compare segments, and monitor overall performance.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Clear variations in customer purchasing behavior across segments
- Identification of high-value customer groups based on spending patterns
- Observable trends that help understand customer preferences
- Insights that can support targeted marketing and retention strategies

## 📝 Conclusion
This project showcases how combining database management, analytical programming, and business intelligence tools can transform raw customer data into actionable insights. The approach is scalable and can be adapted for real-world business analytics, customer segmentation, and decision-making use cases.
